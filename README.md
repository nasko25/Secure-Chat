## Description
This will hopefully be a secure chat web application that is implemented in a very secure way - using cryptographic principles to ensure that the messages sent between the clients are impossible to be read by a third party.

## Install the needed dependencies 
Run 
``` bash 
npm install
cd client 
npm install
```
to download both the server and react client needed dependencies.

## How to run 
You could either run 
``` bash 
npm run startAll 
```
to run both the server and react client scripts at the same time, or run
``` bash 
npm start 
```
in the home directory to start the server and then on a different terminal run 
``` bash
cd client
npm start 
```
